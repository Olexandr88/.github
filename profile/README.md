Story Protocol is building the Programmable IP layer to bring programmability to IP. Story Protocol transforms IPs into networks that transcend mediums and platforms, unleashing global creativity and liquidity. Story Protocol provides the following features.

- IP Repository: Creators can upload their worksâ€™ copyright proof to the chain.
- Powerful Modules: Provides high-efficiency combinability of works.


Story Protocol creates the future of creativity through the synergy of programmable IP and AI. Programmable IP means expressing IP as programmable code.
Programmable IP modularizes the elements of works and enables interaction with other works. For example, a character made with programmable IP can enter the world of another work, communicate with other characters, or create new stories.

AI plays a role in maximizing the creativity of programmable IP.
AI can analyze, optimize, combine, transform, and generate the modules of programmable IP.

AI increases the diversity and quality of programmable IP and creates new value. For example, AI can change the personality or appearance of a character made with programmable IP, create a new character, or generate the dialogue or behavior of a character.

Story Protocol is building open IP infrastructure to grow the creativity of the internet era through the innovative combination of programmable IP and AI. Story Protocol allows creators to express, share, utilize, and monetize their works more freely.

Story Protocol opens up new possibilities for IP that go beyond the boundaries of works. Story Protocol is waiting for your creativity!
